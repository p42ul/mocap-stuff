# MoCap Tools

Just some tools for doing motion capture work with Matlab.

`mocap_animate.m` A quicker and easier way to animate 3D mocap data than MCT for Matlab.

`connect_markers.m` Another way to connect Vicon markers. This one works, I think.
`join_representation.m` A way to connect markers from data recorded on a Vicon. Currently not working.
